            <h4>My First Job in Tech</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>
              I began working as an IT intern in early 2023 at a 
              mid-sized CPA firm to modernize thier tech stack. Their software
              enviornment was disjointed, and they were assigning repetitive,
              time consuming tasks to interns that took up to 25 working hours
              to complete.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the end of the year, with my expertise, the firm connected
              together 2 separate software enviornments through an API, and I
              automated a data pipeline so that their invoice software easily
              connected to their database system, leading to a 50% savings in labor hours among interns.

            <h4>My Research</h4>
          <hr/> 
          <p>
          My academic research focuses on generative transformer models, mainly around the application of Wav2lip (see here) on animated videos. I adapt this model to a custom dataset
          that we are building, in order to get better results than from the model that is trained on human videos. You can see more of the technical aspects of my research <a href = https://github.com/davidkundrats/lipsync-research> here.</a>
